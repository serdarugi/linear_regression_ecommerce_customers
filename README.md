# linear_regression_ecommerce_customers
The goal of the project is to predict customer value (likely revenue or spending) and understand which user behaviors are the most important drivers of this value. Specifically, I was trying to answer:

Should the company focus on improving the mobile app, the website, or increasing membership time?


Data & Features Used
I built a linear regression model using the following features:

Avg. Session Length – How long users stay per session

Time on App – Total time users spend in the mobile app

Time on Website – Total time users spend on the website

Length of Membership – How long users have been members

I have trained the model and obtained predictions of customer value. Then, I have compared:

Actual values (from the test set)

Predicted values (from your model)

The predictions were close to actuals, showing a reasonably accurate model.


Key Insight
Mobile app usage and long-term membership are strong predictors of customer value.

Website usage has almost no effect.
